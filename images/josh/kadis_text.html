<p>Hi, I’m <a href="http://www.kadisco.com" title="Kadisco" target="_blank">Josh Kadis</a>. <b>I’ll be moving to Brooklyn in August, and I’m looking for a job in creative technology.</b> At BDW, I’ve done strategy, production, and development for projects like <a href="http://www.kadisco.com/portfolio/projects/ms.php" title="Zombies Vs Hippies" target="_blank">Zombies Vs Hippies</a> and <a href="http://www.kadisco.com/portfolio/projects/ix.php" title="Shuttle Tracker" target="_blank">Shuttle Tracker</a>. I also work as a UX designer & developer for <a href="http://www.kadisco.com/portfolio/projects/cm.php" title="COMMON" target="_blank">COMMON</a>. Before all that, I freelanced as a digital strategist, copywriter, and content producer in the bicycle industry for brands like <a href="http://www.kadisco.com/portfolio/projects/sr.php" title="SRAM" target="_blank">SRAM</a> and <a href="http://www.kadisco.com/portfolio/projects/zp.php" title="Zipp" target="_blank">Zipp</a>.</p>

<p>I learn best by building things but I can also think strategically and communicate effectively. And I can probably fix your bike.</p>
