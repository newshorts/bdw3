\f0\fs28 \cf0 In semi-short, I am an innovator, inventor, designer, conduit of culture, chance taker, thrill seeker, gadget addict, night owl, \'93why not\'94 asker, traffic hater, hat wearer, bike jumper, often speeding, comedy loving, pixel perfectionist, doodle on everything, solution based digital creative.  \
As a creator, I believe there\'92s always a way to connect our physical world to digital. Analog is not dead; it simply needs a creative bridge in order to merge those valuable experiences onto shareable digital platforms.  Enhancing or entertaining consumer lives where they are is what makes ideas scale, and brands grow.  \
